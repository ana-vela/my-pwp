# my-pwp
My Personal Website Project
This is the preliminary planning for my website which includes creating a purpose, audience, goal, persona, and use case.

## Milestone 1 Feedback

Good job with the purpose, audience, and goals. You make it very clear in this section what your final reasoning is for creating this site. For your goals, you say that you want to highlight your work - how will you do that with your final PWP? Think about that question while working on the second milestone and beyond. Will you showcase your work via a simple link to your downloadable resume and other documents so your website is clean and open, or will you insert pictures and informative sections about your experience directly onto the front end of the site? Think of ways to make your site very informative to employers, but also keep the website clean, easy to navigate, and aesthetically pleasing to visitors. 

I also want to give you props for mentioning Angular 2 and how it will benefit you when it comes to hire-ability. I would definitely continue to highlight this throughout development of your website, as showing an employer that you're able and willing to learn new languages is very impressive. 

Great job on the first milestone. You've passed in Tier IV - you are clear to begin work on Milestone 2a. Keep up the good work.

## Milestone 2&alpha; Feedback
Very nice work here. Your wireframes and content strategy will serve you well as a guide for your development phase. The layout you've chosen will be simple to develop using the Bootstrap Framework and grid system, which we will be covering this Thursday.

Regarding your top navigation/navbar: You may end up short on room on very narrow screens, like on an iPhone5. Bootstrap has a pre-built collapsing menu included, so you might want to consider using this kind of a menu just for those very small mobile screens. We can, with the help of Bootstrap, load one navbar on small screens, and another on large screens. Just something to keep in mind.

What are your plans for featuring your gallery content? If you want a gallery thumbnail-style gallery with a pop-up "lightbox" effect, take a look at the  [Swipebox](http://brutaldesign.github.io/swipebox/) plugin. This plugin is mobile friendly. The documentation is on the light side, but it is not too difficult to install and I can help if you have questions.

For your Social Media and other icons, take a look [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/). Very easy to use, simple and straightforward.

Prior to our in-class coverage on the Bootstrap framework this Thursday, have a look at the [Official Bootstrap Documentation](http://getbootstrap.com/) and the [Deep Dive Bootstrap Material](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/class-materials/bootstrap/).

Very nice work here. Your Milestone 2&alpha; passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). Prior to covering Bootstrap on Thursday, you can opt to use this time to begin collecting and creating your content and imagery.
