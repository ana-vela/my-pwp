# my-pwp
My Personal Website Project
This is the preliminary planning for my website which includes creating a purpose, audience, goal, persona, and use case.



## Milestone 1 Feedback

Good job with the purpose, audience, and goals. You make it very clear in this section what your final reasoning is for creating this site. For your goals, you say that you want to highlight your work - how will you do that with your final PWP? Think about that question while working on the second milestone and beyond. Will you showcase your work via a simple link to your downloadable resume and other documents so your website is clean and open, or will you insert pictures and informative sections about your experience directly onto the front end of the site? Think of ways to make your site very informative to employers, but also keep the website clean, easy to navigate, and aesthetically pleasing to visitors. 

I also want to give you props for mentioning Angular 2 and how it will benefit you when it comes to hire-ability. I would definitely continue to highlight this throughout development of your website, as showing an employer that you're able and willing to learn new languages is very impressive. 

Great job on the first milestone. You've passed in Tier IV - you are clear to begin work on Milestone 2a. Keep up the good work.
