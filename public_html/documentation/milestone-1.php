			<h2>Use Case</h2>
				<p>Christina advertised for two interns on a college job board and asked for potential candidates to include a resume and cover letter with a portfolio link. After one week, Christina looks at the applications so far. Because there are so many applicants, she chooses the top 10 candidates and browses through their portfolio sites. Christina sees that I am one of the few applicants with Angular 2 experience. She also recognizes my name from a networking event at FatPipe ABQ. After looking through my portfolio site, Christina decides to call me that day to set up an interview for Tuesday morning of the following week.
